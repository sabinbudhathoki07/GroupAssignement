            <h3>Contract Mining Agreement</h3>
            <P>This container contains the detail descriptions of the contract paper.
                Establish good professional relationships and prevent future
                 misunderstandings with a general contract for services. Also known 
                 as an agreement for services or service contract, it defines the relationship 
                 between the business providing a service and the person or business receiving it.
                  A general contract for services helps both parties by creating a clear record of the price, 
                  duration of services, obligations, and more, so if one party disagrees, the other is protected.</P>
